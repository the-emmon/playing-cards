Hey, thanks for stopping by, I'm Ryan!

I grew up in Kansas City, but I've been disguised as a Chicagoan for a couple years and I'm loving it.

I'm currently working hard on getting my OSCP. I'm passionate about Linux privilege escalation techniques - sysadmins beware!
In addition to grinding CTFs for my upcoming exam, I've been bouncing between learning C, Javascript, and analyzing the code of various vulnerable open-source projects.
I love writing code that I feel is missing in the world. I've written a couple tools that I've shared with the OSCP-prep community, and I've got a few more in the works. Stay tuned!

Familiar technologies: Wordpress, Docker, Gatsby, Memcached, Apache, Git, SQL Server, MySQL, and I've done a bit of pentesting work involving AWS and GraphQL.

Languages: Nim, Python, PHP, Bash, SQL, CSS. 

I also do a good impression of someone who knows Ruby, but it's not a language I've ever used in a project.

If you're still reading, shoot me a message at remmons@ryanmichaelemmons.com and introduce yourself! I'm always thrilled to connect with anyone passionate about security.
