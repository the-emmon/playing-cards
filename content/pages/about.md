Hey, thanks for stopping by, I'm Ryan!

I grew up in Kansas City, but I've been disguised as a Chicagoan for a couple years and am loving it.

Here are some highlights of my work thus far:

* I passed my OSCP exam in just 6 hours. By the 12-hour mark, I had 100/100 points.
* I nabbed a bug bounty from the government of Singapore by pulling off a tricky WAF bypass, then escalating a SSRF bug to remote code execution.
* I identified a full host-takeover vulnerability in Oracle Virtualbox, CVE-2021-35538. It was the highest-severity vulnerability in Oracle's critical October 2021 patch.
* In an afternoon, I developed two working exploits: one to crash any Nim web framework, another to hijack any account on any site running NimForum software, including the official Nim forum itself. CVEs for those are pending.
